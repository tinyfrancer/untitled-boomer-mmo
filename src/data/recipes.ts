 * duration, and the only thing crafting adds is that the inputs are a *list* and
 * the failure output is optional. Cooking is the one-input case that names a
 * burnt result; smithing is the multi-input case that names none.
 *
 * **What a failure costs is decided by `failureItemId` alone.** Naming one means
 * the inputs are consumed and that is what you get back — a burnt fish, which is
 * what makes levelling cooking worth anything. Leaving it unset means a failure
 * consumes nothing at all and costs only the time it took, which is the right
 * answer for a bar: ore is heavy, slow to carry home, and a smith who destroys
 * one on a roll is punishing the wrong half of the loop.
